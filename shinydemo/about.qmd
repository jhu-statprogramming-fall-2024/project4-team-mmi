## Project Overview

We want to investigate the correlation between climate and weather-related conditions and outbreaks of two respiratory viruses, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Influenza is an RNA virus from the *Orthomyxoviridae* family that frequently mutates, causing seasonal epidemics, while RSV is an RNA virus from the *Paramyxoviridae* family that primarily affects young children and the elderly, often leading to severe lower respiratory infections.

Both viruses pose significant public health challenges due to their widespread transmission and potential for severe disease.

Climate and weather conditions can influence the activity and spread of both viruses. Studies have suggested that factors like cold temperatures, low indoor humidity, limited sunlight, and rapid weather changes may increase the risk of outbreaks.

## Project Goals

In this project, we integrated weather data and disease incidence data together to perform correlation and regression analysis and to build an interactive dashboard showing those relationships. 

## Data Source

Disease rate data were scrapped from CDC RESP-NET API.

Weather data were scrapped from Openmeteo API.
