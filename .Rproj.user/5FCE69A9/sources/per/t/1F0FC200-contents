	abstract = {In this paper, investigations of Sentiment Analysis over a well-known Social Media Twitter were done. As literatures show that some works related to Twitter Sentiment Analysis have been done and delivered interesting idea of features, but there is no a comparative study that shows the best features in performing Sentiment Analysis. In total we used 9 feature sets (41 attributes) that comprise punctuation, lexical, part of speech, emoticon, SentiWord lexicon, AFINN-lexicon, Opinion lexicon, Senti-Strength method, and Emotion lexicon. Feature analysis was done by conducting supervised classification for each feature sets and continued with feature selection in subjectivity and polarity domain. By using four different datasets, the results reveal that AFINN lexicon and Senti-Strength method are the best current approaches to perform Twitter Sentiment Analysis.},

	abstract = {AIM: The purpose of this retrospective, correlational pilot study was to explore the relationship between historical weekly weather data including temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, visibility, and cloud cover compared to weekly influenza-like illness reports over a four year period.
BACKGROUND: Climate and weather-related conditions may affect the viral activity and transmission of influenza, although this relationship has not been widely studied in nursing. Some research suggests that there are causal links between cold temperatures, low indoor humidity, minimal sun exposure, and influenza outbreaks. Additionally, rapid weather variability in a warming climate can increase influenza epidemic risk.
METHODS: Data from a local public health district were extracted and used to correlate with weekly weather averages for the area.
RESULTS: Findings showed that current influenza reports are significantly associated with temperature and visibility, both lagged two weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: Though more research is needed, nurses must understand, recognize, and act upon weather and climate factors that affect the health of populations. With a greater understanding of the relationship between weather and influenza-like illness, nurses and other healthcare providers can potentially work to respond to and mitigate the consequences of weather-related illness as well as anticipate and prepare for increased flu burden. Furthermore, nurses can remain engaged in climate protective initiatives and policy development at their local community and/or organizational levels to underscore and advocate for the needs of populations and groups they serve.},

	abstract = {The influences of weather and air pollutants on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been well-studied. However, the heterogeneous effects of different influenza viral infections, air pollution and weather on COPD admissions and re-admissions have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationships between meteorological variables, air pollutants, seasonal influenza, and hospital admissions and re-admissions due to COPD in Hong Kong, a non-industrial influenza epicenter. A total number of 507703 hospital admissions (i.e., index admissions) and 301728 re-admission episodes (i.e., episodes within 30 days after the previous discharge) for COPD over 14 years (1998-2011) were obtained from all public hospitals. The aggregated weekly numbers were matched with meteorological records and outdoor air pollutant concentrations. Type-specific and all-type influenza-like illness positive (ILI+) rates were used as proxies for influenza activity. Generalized additive models were used in conjunction with distributed-lag non-linear models to estimate the associations of interest. According to the results, high concentrations of fine particulate matter, oxidant gases, and cold weather were strong independent risk factors of COPD outcomes. The cumulative adjusted relative risks exhibited a monotone increasing trend except for ILI+ B, and the numbers were statistically significant over the entire observed range of ILI+ total and ILI+ A/H3N2 when the reference rate was zero. COPD hospitalization risk from influenza infection was higher in the elderly than that in the general population. In conclusion, our results suggest that health administrators should impose clean air policies, such as strengthening emissions control on petrol vehicles, to reduce pollution from oxidant gases and particulates. An extension of the influenza vaccination program for patients with COPD may need to be encouraged: for example, vaccination may be included in hospital discharge planning, particularly before the winter epidemic.},

	abstract = {In this study, we use a statistical approach based on generalized additive models, linking atmospheric circulation and the number of influenza-related hospital admissions in the Spanish Iberian Peninsula during 2003-2013. The relative risks are estimated for administrative units in the Spanish territory, which is politically structured into 15 regions called autonomous communities. A catalog of atmospheric circulation types is defined for this purpose. The relationship between the exposure and response variables is modeled using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM). Types from southwest and anticyclonic are significant in terms of the probability of having more influenza-related hospital admissions for all of Spain. The heterogeneity of the results is very high. The relative risk is also estimated for each autonomous community and weather type, with the maximum number of influenza-related hospital admissions associated with circulation types from the southwest and the south. We identify six specific situations where relative risk is considered extreme and twelve with a high risk of increasing influenza-related hospital admissions. The rest of the situations present a moderate risk. Atmospheric local conditions become a key factor for understanding influenza spread in each spatial unit of the Peninsula. Further research is needed to understand how different weather variables (temperature, humidity, and sun radiation) interact and promote the spread of influenza.},

	abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a leading cause of global child morbidity and mortality. Every year, seasonal RSV outbreaks put high pressure on paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) worldwide, including in the Netherlands, and this burden appears to be increasing. Weather conditions have a strong influence on RSV activity, and climate change has been proposed as a potential important determinant of future RSV-related health care utilisation. In this national study spanning a total of 13 years with 2161 PICU admissions for RSV bronchiolitis, we aimed (1) to identify meteorological variables that were associated with the number of PICU admissions for RSV bronchiolitis in the Netherlands and (2) to determine if longitudinal changes in these variables occurred over time as a possible explanation for the observed increase in PICU burden. Poisson regression modelling was used to identify weather variables (aggregated in months and weeks) that predicted PICU admissions, and linear regression analysis was used to assess changes in the weather over time. Maximum temperature and global radiation best predicted PICU admissions, with global radiation showing the most stable strength of effect in both month and week data. However, we did not observe a significant change in these weather variables over the 13-year time period. Based on our study, we could not identify changing weather conditions as a potential contributing factor to the increased RSV-related PICU burden in the Netherlands.},
